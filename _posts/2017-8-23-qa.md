## Questions

This is a list of hyphotetical marketing-related questions about the DVD rental store under study. In the next section I provide an answer for each of this questions by running queries against the Sakila database.

1. Where are our most popular stores?
2. What is the total revenue of all of our stores?
3. Which stores make the most money? Which make the least?
4. What are the most popular films that customers rent?
5. What is the average rental duration?
6. Do we make the most money from long or short rentals?
7. We want to acquire more films. Which genres are most popular?
8. We want to hire an actor to do ads for us. Which actor is in the most films?
9. We want to hire an actor to do ads for us. Which actors/actresses are most popular given our rental history?
10. Pick the top customers. Given the films they’ve rented, which new ones should we suggest to them?

## Answers

### 1. Where are our most popular stores?

First things first, how many stores are there?

~~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(store_id) 
FROM store;
~~~~

There is a total of two DVD rental stores.

Assuming that the most popular store is the one that has the biggest number of customers, I aggregate the number of customers per store by running the following query:

~~~~sql
SELECT s.store_id, a.address, ci.city, co.country, 
  COUNT(cu.customer_id) AS customer_number 
FROM store s JOIN address a ON s.address_id = a.address_id 
  JOIN city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id 
  JOIN country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id 
  JOIN customer cu ON s.store_id = cu.store_id 
GROUP BY cu.store_id;
~~~~

The store located in Lethbridge, Canada, is the most popular store according to the number of customers.

### 2. What is the total revenue of all of our stores?

~~~~sql
SELECT SUM(amount) 
FROM payment;
~~~~

The total revenue from all stores is $67416.51

### 3. Which stores make the most money? Which make the least?

The following table breaks down the total revenue per store.

~~~~sql
SELECT s.store_id, 
  SUM(p.amount) AS total_sales 
FROM store s JOIN staff st ON s.store_id = st.store_id 
  JOIN payment p ON st.staff_id = p.staff_id 
GROUP BY s.store_id;
~~~~

And we can see that the store in Australia (`store_id` 2) makes the most money even when it's not the store with the most number of customers.

The store that makes the least money is the store in Canada (`store_id` 1).

### 4. What are the most popular films that customers rent?

~~~~sql
SELECT f.film_id, f.title, c.name AS category,
  COUNT(rental_id) AS times_rented
FROM inventory i LEFT JOIN rental r ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
  LEFT JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id 
  LEFT JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id 
  LEFT JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id 
GROUP BY f.film_id 
ORDER BY COUNT(rental_id) DESC 
LIMIT 10;
~~~~

Here is a top 10 of the most popular films that customers rent:

<table>
  <thead><th>Film ID</th><th>Film Title</th><th>Category</th><th>Times Rented</th></thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for x in site.data.top10-films %}
      <tr><td>{{ x.filmID }}</td><td>{{ x.title }}</td><td>{{ x.category }}</td><td>{{ x.times-rented }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

### 5. What is the average rental duration?

~~~~sql
SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, rental_date, return_date)) 
FROM rental;
~~~~

The average rental duration is 7236.4757 minutes. That is aproximately 5 days.

### 6. Do we make the most money from long or short rentals?

_Since the average rental duration is 5 days, I will consider rentals that last less than 5 days as short, and rentals of 5 or more days as long rentals._

~~~~sql
SELECT SUM(p.amount) 
FROM payment p JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id 
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute, r.rental_date, return_date) >= 7236.4757;
~~~~

The total revenue from long rentals is $42488.77

~~~~sql
SELECT SUM(p.amount) 
FROM payment p JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id 
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute, r.rental_date, return_date) < 7236.4757;
~~~~

The total revenue from long rentals is $24399.62

The store makes more money from the long rentals.

__Notice:__ If we add up the total revenue from shorts and long rentals, the value obtained is $66888.39. 

Previously I said that the total revenue from all stores was $67416.51. There is a difference of $528.12 between that value and the one I just obtained, why?

I have one theory, and it's that the the rental_id in the `payment` table can be NULL and it's not matching all the rental_id values in the `rental` table (`rental_id` is not a foreign key in the `payment` table, so it can have NULL values).

~~~~sql
SELECT SUM(amount) 
FROM payment 
WHERE rental_id IS NULL;
~~~~

The value I obtained from running that query is $9.95.
I'm still missing $518.17 to complete the $528.12 difference. I try this query:

~~~~sql
SELECT SUM(p.amount) 
FROM payment p JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id 
WHERE r.rental_date IS NULL OR return_date IS NULL;
~~~~

In this case I thought that maybe the `rental_date` or the `return_date` in the `rental` table could be NULL, and the value I obtained is $518.17, which is exactly the amount I was missing.

To display the NULL values I run:

~~~~sql
SELECT p.amount, r.rental_date, return_date 
FROM payment p JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id 
WHERE r.rental_date IS NULL OR return_date IS NULL
LIMIT 10;
~~~~

<table>
  <thead><th>Payment</th><th>Rental Date</th><th>Return Date</th></thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for x in site.data.not-returned %}
      <tr><td>{{ x.amount }}</td><td>{{ x.rental_date }}</td><td>{{ x.return_date }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

And I can see that in all the cases the return date is NULL, which means that those films have not been returned yet but maybe the customer payed in advance.

### 7. We want to acquire more films. Which genres are most popular?

~~~~sql
SELECT c.name AS category, COUNT(rental_id) AS times_rented 
FROM rental r 
  JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
  JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id 
  JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id 
  JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id 
GROUP BY c.name 
ORDER BY times_rented DESC;
~~~~

<table>
  <thead><th>Category</th><th>Times Rented</th></thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for x in site.data.top-categories %}
      <tr><td>{{ x.category }}</td><td>{{ x.times_rented }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

The table above lists the total number of rentals divided per film category. The three most popular categories are sports, animation and action; if the company wants to buy more films I would advise to look at those categories first, and then go down the list.

### 8. We want to hire an actor to do ads for us. Which actor is in the most films?

~~~~sql 
SELECT fa.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name, 
  COUNT(fa.film_id) AS number_of_films
FROM film_actor fa 
JOIN actor a ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id 
GROUP BY fa.actor_id 
ORDER BY number_of_films DESC 
LIMIT 10; 
~~~~

<table>
  <thead><th>Actor ID</th><th>First Name</th><th>Last Name</th><th>Number of Films</th></thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for x in site.data.top-actors-inventory %}
      <tr><td>{{ x.actorID }}</td><td>{{ x.first_name }}</td><td>{{ x.last_name }}</td><td>{{ x.num_films }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

Gina Degeneres (`actor_id` 107), is the actress in most films, followed by Walter Torn (`actor_id` 102), and Mary Keitel (`actor_id` 198). If the store wants to hire an actor/actress to do ads, I would advise to reach out to those three actors first.

### 9. We want to hire an actor to do ads for us. Which actors/actresses are most popular given our rental history?

~~~~sql 
SELECT fa.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name, 
  COUNT(rental_id) AS times_rented 
FROM actor a JOIN film_actor fa ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id 
  JOIN film f ON fa.film_id = f.film_id 
  JOIN inventory i ON i.film_id = f.film_id 
  JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id 
GROUP BY actor_id 
ORDER BY times_rented DESC
LIMIT 10; 
~~~~

<table>
  <thead><th>Actor ID</th><th>First Name</th><th>Last Name</th><th>Number of Times Rented</th></thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for x in site.data.top-actors-rentals %}
      <tr><td>{{ x.actorID }}</td><td>{{ x.first_name }}</td><td>{{ x.last_name }}</td><td>{{ x.num_rentals }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>


Given the store rental history, the most popular actresses are Gina Degeneres (`actor_id` 107), Matthew Carrey (`actor_id` 181), and Mary Keitel (`actor_id` 198).

__Note:__ Is this table correct? Let's corroborate the data with a few separate queries.

This query gives me all the films in which the actress with `actor_id` 107 performs.

~~~~sql 
SELECT * 
FROM film_actor 
WHERE actor_id = 107
LIMIT 10;
~~~~

This query shows all the copies of the previous films in inventory in the different stores.

~~~~sql 
SELECT inventory_id 
FROM inventory 
WHERE film_id IN (SELECT * 
    FROM film_actor 
    WHERE actor_id = 107);
~~~~

Now let's count how many times those films where rented.

~~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM rental 
WHERE inventory_id IN (SELECT inventory_id 
    FROM inventory 
    WHERE film_id IN (SELECT film_id 
        FROM film_actor 
	WHERE actor_id = 107));
~~~~

The number obtained is 753 and it's the same we can see in the summary table that we wanted to corroborate.

### 10. Pick the top customers. Given the films they’ve rented, which new ones should we suggest to them?

~~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(customer_id) 
FROM customer;
~~~~

There is a total of 599 customers considering all the rental stores.

The following query results in a table with the total number of films rented per customer. I'll consider that the top customers are the ones that rented the most films.

~~~~sql
SELECT customer_id, count(rental_id) AS times_rented 
FROM rental 
GROUP BY customer_id 
ORDER BY times_rented DESC 
LIMIT 5;
~~~~

<table>
  <thead><th>Customer ID</th><th>Total Number of Rentals</th></thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for x in site.data.top-customers %}
      <tr><td>{{ x.customerID }}</td><td>{{ x.num_rentals }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

Then I can look at the films rented by each customer. Let's take the top customer with `customer_id` 148.

~~~~sql
SELECT r.customer_id, ca.name, 
  COUNT(ca.name) AS times_rented 
FROM rental r JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
  JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id 
  JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id 
  JOIN category ca ON fc.category_id = ca.category_id 
WHERE customer_id = 148 
GROUP BY ca.name 
ORDER BY times_rented DESC;
~~~~

<table>
  <thead><th>Customer ID</th><th>Film Category</th><th>Times Rented</th></thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for x in site.data.top-customers-categories %}
      <tr><td>{{ x.customerID }}</td><td>{{ x.category }}</td><td>{{ x.times_rented }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

For the customer with ID 148, I would suggest more films in the Sci-Fi and Family categories.
